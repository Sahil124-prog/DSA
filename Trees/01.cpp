    Tree -> it is a non linear , hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected to edges .
    Binary Tree -> a tree is a binary tree when every node has at most two children
        Terminologies-
        `1.Leaf -> a node without any children.
        2. Internal node -> if a node has child.
        3. Siblings -> 2 nodes that have same parent
        4. Length Path -> the length of path is one less than the numner of nodes on the path.
        5. Ancestors and Descendents -> if there is a path from node A to node B , then A is called an ancestor of B and B is called a descendent of A
        6. Subtree -> any node of a tree , with all of its descendents is a subtree
        7. Level ->  the level of the node referes to its distance from the root , the root of the tree has generally level 0
